## Some Notes  
Before browsing the website, notice:  
* Some pages require the user to be logged in. For the purpose of demonstration and for having a better user experience, you may want to login as the following user:  
	**Email**: guestUser@gmail.co.uk  
	**Pass**: 42214221Dd  
	However, you can create a new account if you wish.  
* Listing data are generated randomly using a small Java software that I wrote, code of which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/iamhosseindhv/1eb775b4a2bcda31fd3c834d0eb9208c).
* Due to the fact that there are not sufficient data for every listing's page, for the purpose of demonstration by clicking on a listing you will be randomly redirected to **3** predefined pages.
* Since the project is still under development, some features may not work as expected. They will be fixed. SOON üîú.
